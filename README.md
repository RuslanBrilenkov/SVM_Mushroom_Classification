# SVM_Mushroom_Classification
This is my tutorial on how one can use Scikit-learn Python library to classify the mushroom data set on classes: edible VS. poisonous. 

In this tutorial, we do the following:

1. download the dat set from the archive;
2. pre-process it using train-test split technique & select the most relevant features for training;
3. initialize and train our SVM classifier;
4. make predictions using the testing set.
